D.J. Anthoney.  Then this system was networked through the island via a center of catechism.  Sooner the Buddhists too followed this system as per the history.\n\nSunday School in Bambalapitiya parish was in active for a quite a long time.  However it was revamped in the year 2008 at the time of centenary year of the parish.  This includes;   Installing 11 teachers;  identifying all 3 mediums (Sinhala/English \u0026 Tamil) to be facilitated, initiating a the 10.30 mass as the childrens mass are 3 mile stones taken place at this stage.  Today our Sunday school has approximately 270 children and 33 teachers from KG to year 11 in 3 mediums.\n\nDespite investing many hours in hard work in preparing and acquiring knowledge each week the following activities are being conducted by the Sunday School teams.\n\nThe Lenten Pilgrimage, Christmas party, Celebrating Children’s day in Tewatte, Nativity play,  Bible quiz programs etc….\n\nFollowing is the volunteer teachers past and present who have contributed to the Sunday school in different ways.\n\n\n\u003ctable class=\"subpage-table\"\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSenior teachers and other supporters–past and present\u003c/strong\u003e\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoung teachers – past and present\u003c/strong\u003e\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eAjantha Manthri\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Amali de Silva\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Anne Seneviratne\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Ashanti Fernando\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Chrishanthi Chelliah\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Dinali De Silva\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Felina\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Ganga Jasenthuliyana\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Geethika Amaratunga\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Goretti Paiva\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Imalka Bosco\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Jacinta Jayasekera\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Karan Bird\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Melanie Nanayakkara\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Manel De Alwis\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Michelle Fonseka\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Monisha Cruez\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Nadishani Makalanda\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Nilukshi Fonseka\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Nirasha Gomez\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Nirmala Joseph\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Niroshani Wanniarachchi\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Pravinda David\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Rukshini Micheal\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Ruwanmalie\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Shahan Micheal\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Shalini Perera\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Sharron De Alwis\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Sharron Steinwall\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Sr Himali\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Sr Sujeewa\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Sujeewa\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Nadeeshani Makalanda\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Virginia Daniel\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eSusal Dabera\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Senuri Dabera\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Anithra Lihinikaduwa\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Anik De Mel\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Levin Dharmawardana\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Chathura De Silva\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Nayomi Makalanda\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Priyandan Francis\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Sanchia Steinwall\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Amandi Kotelawala\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Sanoli Krishnan\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Aneesha Henry\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Shammara Fonseka\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Shauntel Soris\n      \u003cbr /\u003e\n      Shuntel Fonseca\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n The principal of the sunday school is the parish priest assisted with 3 coordinators for each medium. \n\n **Contact Information –**\n\nEnglish Medium head teacher – Nilukshi Fonseka 077-770-5500 \n\nTamil Medium head teacher – Ms. Rukshini -  077-248-8676\n\nSinhala Medium head teacher – Ganga Jasenthuliyana – 077-311-8101\n\n"},"nextPost":{"slug":"choirs","frontmatter":{"title":"Parish Choir","description":"Parish Choir","date":"April 16, 2020"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nThe Parish choir sings at the 7.00am and 6.00pm mass on every\n\n\nSunday.

Fr. Gino Henriques \u0026amp; Rev. Fr. Shanti Abeysingha conducted a youth\nprogram at St Mary\u0026#39;s and introduced a more vibrant style of music to the Mass. The parish priest at that time\nwas Fr. Basil Weeratunge, and his Assistant was Rev. Fr. Reginald Saparamadhu. It was in many\nways an off-shoot of the St. Mary\u0026#39;s Choral Group (SMCG) and Youth Choir begun by the Rome-\nordained Rev. Fr. Claver Perera when he was Assistant Parish Priest, in 1967 as it comprised mostly\nthe members of those choirs.\n\nThe initial selection of the youth choir music comprised of songs such as; *My Sweet Lord, I\u0026#39;d like to teach the world to sing* , and selections from the off-Broadway musical *Godspell*.\n\nThe choir grew informally by word of mouth, the average age being 19. Soon the choir was singing at\nthe 8.30am Sunday mass, continuing to call themselves the Youth Choir - maybe justified by the\nselection of music and youthful attitude of its members some of whom may not technically have\nbeen youth anymore! Perhaps the name was also prompted by the fact that St Mary’s has for many\nyears prided itself in having an outstanding Church Choir conducted at that time by renowned late\nProf. Earle de Fonseka with a membership of many renowned singers including the late Lorraine\nAbeysekera, Bede de Zilwa, and Mary Anne David - the last still contributes to the music world.\nHence the label youth choir was more an aspect of differentiation!\n\nThough it initially began with guitars, there was the addition of an organ which accompanied a\nmixture of modern songs and ballads such as He aint heavy he’s my brother and songs by the\nBeatles, Bread, Blood Sweat and Tears and Queen. More instruments such as bass and electric\nguitars, saxophone, piano, clarinet and flute were added in 1978.\n\nIn 1980 Fr. Claver, the new parish priest guided the Youth Choir and introduced serious mixed voice\nchoral harmonies. He further shared his experience in Italy. Fr. Claver built up the Choir\u0026#39;s repertoire\nin Choral music and plainchant. The Parish invested in a Viscount Domus 8 organ for the church,\nfurther enriching the standard of the choir. In 1986 the choir under the direction of Fr. Claver,\nreleased its first cassette titled Pass it On which was popular and widely sought.\n\nThe choir went on to perform at concert venues, hotels in Colombo, Choral festivals and at the\nNational Seminary in Ampitiya. A major milestone was its participation in the Mozart Death\nBicentenary Choral Festival held at the Anglican Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour by the late\nKalasuri Lylie Godridge. The introduction of a Yamaha EL90, enhanced the singing further with a\nwider repertoire.\n\nIn June 2007 the choir changed its name to St. Mary\u0026#39;s Choral Group or SMCG, a name dating from\nFr. Claver\u0026#39;s original male voice choir of 1967. The choir still sings at the 8.30am Sunday Eucharistic\nCelebration which is its primary function.\n\nIt also sings for the Church Feast, selected other major Feasts of the Church, Easter Tridium services\nthe annual Carol Service, and Christmas Midnight Mass. Most of its current members are non-\nparishioners, and are students or working professionals, giving of their time and talent. It could be\nsaid that the secret of its continuity and success in singing comes from a common love of music, and\ngood camaraderie and a solid foundation laid by Fr. Claver and many of its past conductors /\ndirectors. By the presence of several generations of its past and present members continuing to\ncontribute and sing for the love of it and in the realisation that good music, makes the liturgy more\ninspirational.
