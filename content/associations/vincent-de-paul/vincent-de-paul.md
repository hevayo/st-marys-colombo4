The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul is a lay Catholic organization whose mission is to live the Gospel message by serving Christ in the poor with love, respect, justice and joy. The Mission of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul implies that as Vincentians, we see Christ in anyone who suffers, come together as a family, have personal contact with the poor and help in all possible ways. The SVP Society was established in 1940. 


The meetings are held every second Thursday at the church library at 4.00pm. The regular recipients are given a food voucher from Food City or cash every month. We also help them with medical supplies and support them during a family bereavement. At Christmas, a generous hamper is given to all of them. On the feast of St. Vincent de Paul, after mass, the recipients are given breakfast and household items or linen. Every year a donation is given to a catholic organization, and this year it was the, “Children’s Home of Marc Sri Kaluthara”. During a national disaster, we have come to the help by donated dry rations, school stationary or even cash to the affected. During the Holy week, dry rations are collected and given to the needy. Scholarships are awarded towards the education of deserving students. In 2016 with the support of the Lions Club of Colombo South, a health camp, where eyesight, hearing and general health were checked and medication given as required was carried out. Spectacles were distributed subsequently. During the current pandemic the society looked after the recipients  


As for fund-raising events, a food sale is held in July and a till collection in November. Parishioners and well-wishers too donate towards the projects of the society.


Members join in all the programs organized by the parish at Corpus Christie, Month of May, Holy week and the church feast.
