# Holy Childhood Society

Rev. Fr. Felician Ranjith Perera the Parish Priest inaugurated the Holy Childhood Cell at St Mary's Church Bambalapitiya, in February 2016. Mrs. Amali De Silva was requested to assist the children with the activities of Holy Childhood Society. Thereafter the Coordinator for Colombo South Deanery- Rev. Fr. Sashika Manoj Rodrigo, was contacted and the Animators Mrs. Amali De Silva, & Dinali De Silva went through two, three-day in house training programs in November 2016 and May 2017, to familiarize with the expectations of the society. The Holy Childhood Society assists Christian children from the age group of six (6) years to fourteen (14) years, towards a deeper and stronger experience of the faith through spiritual communion with Christ & self-boosting activities, while respecting the other. Thereafter the children were led with many activities which are briefed below.
