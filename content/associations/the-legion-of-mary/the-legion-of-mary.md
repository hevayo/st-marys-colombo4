The Legion of Mary at St. Mary’s Church is known as, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.The Legion of Mary is a lay catholic organisation whose members give service to the Church on a voluntary basis. The unit of the Legion of Mary is called a praesidium. The Legion of Mary was founded by Frank Duff in 1921 in Dublin. The Legion at St. Mary’s Church has been functioning for over 60 years. Initially there were separate praesidia for men and women. Later it was a mixed praesidia and now the praesidia consists of only women. Meetings are held every Friday at 5.00pm in the parish library. At present there are approximately 10 members. 


The work undertaken by the Legion includes; visiting the elderly and the sick in the parish on a weekly basis including slum areas and recitation of the rosary and other prayers whenever requested. We also make the necessary arrangements to have the various sacraments administered to them whenever required. We have visited homes for elders as well. The recitation of the rosary after daily mass is continues. We help organize the block rosary in certain areas, which is done on a weekly basis and cottage masses whenever they are held. We also get involved with church work by arranging the alter on a weekly and for special occasions. We organize the recitation of the rosary during the month of May.  We visit the funeral homes of our parishioners and recite the rosary and other prayers.
