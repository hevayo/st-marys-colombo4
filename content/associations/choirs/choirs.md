## Childrens Choir

The need for a children's choir arose due to commencing of a children's mass at 10.30 am which commenced in 2008 under the then parish priest ..Rev. Fr. Srian Ranasinghe. Members from Sunday school were invited to join after an audition..


Currently...we have around 25 members who sing with us for the 10.30 am mass
