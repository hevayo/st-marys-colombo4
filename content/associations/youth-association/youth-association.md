The Youth Association at St.Maryâ€™s was established during the time Fr. Honorio Munoz OP served as parish priest (1957-1963).


The youth association of the parish was formed initially during the tenure of Fr. Honorio Munoz OP (1957-1963). Meetings were held in the old club house facing Duplication Road and according to some old time parishioners, the 'Share a meal campaign' was started with the active participation of the youth. After being dormant for some time the youth of St. Mary's Church, Bambalapitiya was revived during the tenure of Fr. Felician Ranjith in 2017, with Mr. Glenn Seneviratne acting as the youth coordinator.


The Youth consists of 30+ members, between the ages of 18-25 years, under the guidance of Mr. Glenn Seneviratne and spiritual direction of Fr. Trevor Martin.
