Marriage Encounter was the brain child of Fr. Sriarn Ranasinghe and commenced on 26th June 2008. it is not an association but a service to the parish. There are no office bearers. The parishioners  carrying out this programme were Nimali and  Anne who volunteered to help for this service. Currently Dr. Maxie Fernandopulle and Shanthi Fernando are conducting this service.

The objective of this service is to help young and old to find marriage partners in life. It is advertised in the Catholic papers It is held in the parish library on Saturdays from 9am to 12 noon. Those who want to find a partner , their parents or family members come and register the person. A file is opened containing the biodata of the person and qualities and the requirements of partner he or she is looking for. They go through the files and if they find suitable person they communicate. If they agree a photograph is annexed in the file
Now it is conducted only on Saturdays only.
